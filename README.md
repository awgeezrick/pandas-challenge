# Observable Trends from Analysis Conducted:

# The schools with higher budgets and larger population sizes did not perform better than smaller-medium sized schools with lower budgets.
# Based on the data for top 5 and bottom 5 schools, it can be inferred that Charter schools have a higher pass rate in all areas over public schools. 
# Charter schools budget and class sizes are smaller which could lead us to review the concept of quality vs. quantity.
# Smaller class sizes could mean more intimate teaching settings and more one-on-one time with students.
